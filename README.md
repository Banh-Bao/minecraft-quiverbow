"Ranged weaponry, as thought up by Steve."

A description of the mod's details can be found here -> https://wildwestscifi.net/coding/9889-and-then-i-did-some-minecraft-modding 
The link should probably be kept around, or the contents over ported here (I saw a wiki of sorts?) in some way for consistency.

The purpose of making this mod open source is so other people can help out maintaining and/or updating it to later versions. My lust for doing so by myself is rather low by this point. Much time has passed and life has moved on.

So! I have no idea how this github thing works. Doing it anyway.

Here are my notes, as I collected and perused them over time. A couple things were started and left unfinished or never published. I can't quite remember what was left half-broken in its wake. Looking through the code, it looks like the last thing I did was overhaul code to move from arrays to ArrayLists. This overhaul likely needs an overhaul itself.

The last public version is Build 101d. The incomplete/broken version is Build 102.

...what else goes into this file? Changelogs?
